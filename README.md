# DSA Practice 📚✨

Welcome to my DSA practice repository!  
This repository documents my solutions to various LeetCode, HackerRank, and other coding problems, organized by difficulty and problem type, with each solution including:

- 🚀 Problem Number & Title
- 🛠️ Problem Type (e.g., Array, Linked List, DP, Tree, Graph, etc.)
- 🧠 My Approach Explanation
- 📄 My Code
- 📈 Time and Space Complexity Analysis
- 🔀 Alternate Approaches with Solutions
